            <h2>Navigation Here <br></h2>
            Here, in the Navigation area, I am demonstrating  what using desendent selectors do and don't do.<br>
            As you can see, "Back to Home" is in a box all on its own. Now here is an example of the CSS code: <br>
            nav ul p{<br>
    background-color: aqua;<br>
    padding: 5px;<br>
    border: 5px dashed #000000;<br>
    margin: 5px;<br>
    width: 200px;
<br>} <br>
            Notice how the definition of the CSS includes "nav", "ul" and "p" are one after the other. That says<br>that only "p" individuals who are desendants of "ul" who are desendants of "nav" will recieve this<br>specific treatment. "Back to Home" meets those requirements, where as "Homework Links" do not.
            <ul><li><p><a href="https://danthomsen42.github.io/">Back to Home</a></p></li>
                <li><a href="/homework-links.html">Homework Links</a></li></ul>
        </nav>
        <main>
            <h2>Pictures</h2>
            <p> Now Look at these pictures with their wonderful borders. Notice how the one with Link and the Dog,<br> and the Pug Fellowship both have green borders around them, and the Speeder Cats have a different <br>red border. That is because the green bordered pictures are identified with the same attribute.
            <br> Example codes:
            <br> img[alt="cat"]{
            <br>background-color: brown;
    <br>padding: 7px;
    <br>border: 5px dotted #010100;
    <br>width: 500px;
<br>}

<br>img[alt="dog"]{
    <br>padding:10px;
    <br>background-color: chartreuse;
    <br>border: ridge #009900;
    <br>border-width: 10px;
    
<br>}

            <br> Both are identified with the "alt" attribute of "dog" as opposed to "cat". Attributes are used
            <br> to identify specific "items" with a name or type. That way those things with the same attributes
            <br> will have the same characteristics.     
            </p>
            <img alt="dog" src="/images/deku_dog.jpg">
            <img alt="cat" src="/images/cat_speeder.png">
            <img alt="dog" src="/images/middleearthpugs.jpg">
            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
           <p>
                Now Children, are perhaps one of the most picky of these Selectors. They only apply 
            <br>to the direct desendants of these "items" and to nothing and no one else.<br> 
            Example:<br>
            <br>main>ul>li>ul{
    <br>background-color: blueviolet;
    <br>border: 5px dashed #809900;
    <br>padding: 5px;
    <br>margin: 5px;
    <br>width: 200px;
               <br>}
             <br> As you can see, only those very specific lines are shaded, and not any of the others.<br>
               They are easily identifiable by ">" down the "ancestral line".
            </p>

                <li>Is this the real life?</li>
                <li>Is this just fantasy?</li>

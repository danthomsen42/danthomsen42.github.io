    <h2>Planning Document</h2>
    <main>
        Project Purpose<br>

The project that I am proposing is a small gaming website of small games (flash style, for the most part, though not actual Flash) created by me, or possibly (though not planned for), games that are web-based open sourced that are properly cited back to their creators.<br>
It will only have between 4 and 6 games on this website that are, if I have time, created in either Game Maker Studio or Clickteam Fusion 2.5. 
These games are quick to create and they will not be the webpages themselves, but instead the pages will be built around these games, or at least, will be the description pages for these games.<br> 
<br>
The Audience<br>
<br>
The Audience that this website is to be built around is your average young child to young adult, or ages 8 – 21, probably more-so towards the younger kids but still have some time-wasting appeal to those that are slightly older. <br>
<br>
Web Pages<br>
<br>
Main Home Page – This is a fairly basic page with 4-6 links to the other gaming pages, but also outlining the purpose of the site which is, in essence, just for fun and time wasting. <br>
<br>
About Me webpage- Fairly strait forward, it will describe me and a little bit about who I am and why I built this website with a picture of me.<br> 
<br>
Contact- Just a little bit of info of how to get ahold of me. It will probably just have an e-mail address, as I don’t really want to give a phone number or an address.<br> 


These next websites will be a description of some of the possible games that will be provided, either on the page or, more likely to keep the weight in check, on a separate page that will be linked to this specific page. <br>
<br>
**Disclaimer: These games are neither promised to be good, finished, nor even fun, as I will probably not overly refine them. I am merely showing the games, not selling them.**<br>
<br>

Simple Platformer – Just a little box that can jump and traverse along the side with a very few simple puzzles. The webpage will give the instructions for game play, and a light introduction into why I made it and a brief description on how it was made.<br>
<br>
Tower Defense- A bunch of balloons, zombies, birds, etc. that will follow a pre-determined path that you do your best to make sure they never see the ending of by building small defensive structures to hold out against them. Just as the previous page had, it will outline the controls and gameplay that will also give a brief description of how I made it and why I made it the way I did.<br>
<br>
Bejewelled style switch game – There are several symbols that you get to try to make a line that when connected will break-apart or fall apart and you get a certain amount of points for the certain symbols .  Same as above, except I will probably make this game on Clickteam Fusion instead of Game Maker Studio.<br>
<br>
 A Very Simple FPS- This will probably be the least finished out of all of them, as it requires a lot more time, as it is 3D, and it will probably be short. There will be no gore of blood of any form, maybe not even enemies, just barrels. It depends on how much effort I can put into it.<br>
<br>
Asteroids- The classic Atari era game with slightly better graphics. Flying around and shooting asteroids is the entire point of the game.  As before, the webpage will be designed to describe the basics on the game.<br>
<br>
A few of these games are well into development, with a bit more refinement needed. They’re what I do in some of my free time.<br>
<br>

You could organize the items by content area or function to demonstrate relationships of pages to one another. A site diagram, while not required, could be useful (example - https://belindapullicino.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/picture-1.png).<br>

<br>
Usability Concepts<br>
<br>

I will go down through the highlighted portions first. I will adjust the line spacing and font size so that it fits the page well and is very easy to read. The images will have a good alt tag. I will probably use said pictures as links to my games, so I will want the tags to be appropriate.<br>
Links will be in very clearly defined areas, both at the bottom and up in the tabs on the page.<br>
The headings will be clearly at the top of the page. Everything else is pretty well lined out with some easy to use and access well defined and viewable.<br>

SEO words: Games, Game Maker, In-development, flash style, free, easy, simple, Daniel Thomsen, early access, fun<br>

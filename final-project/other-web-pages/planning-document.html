    <main>
        Project Purpose<br>

The project that I am proposing is a small gaming website of small games (flash style, for the most part, though not actual Flash) created by me, or possibly (though not planned for), games that are web-based open sourced that are properly cited back to their creators.<br>
It will only have between 4 and 6 games on this website that are, if I have time, created in either Game Maker Studio or Clickteam Fusion 2.5. 
These games are quick to create and they will not be the webpages themselves, but instead the pages will be built around these games, or at least, will be the description pages for these games.<br> 
<br>
The Audience<br>
<br>
The Audience that this website is to be built around is your average young child to young adult, or ages 8 – 21, probably more-so towards the younger kids but still have some time-wasting appeal to those that are slightly older. <br>
<br>
Web Pages<br>
<br>
Main Home Page – This is a fairly basic page with 4-6 links to the other gaming pages, but also outlining the purpose of the site which is, in essence, just for fun and time wasting. <br>
<br>
HTML5 VIDEO USAGE - About webpage- Fairly strait forward, it will describe me and a little bit about who I am and why I built this website with a picture of me. It is also the page that describes the website<br> 
<br>
Contact- Just a little bit of info of how to get ahold of me. It will probably just have an e-mail address, as I don’t really want to give a phone number or an address.<br> 
<br>
Game List Page - This page has very little content, only enough to list the games and a picture of them. If you click on the picture it will take you to the game description page<br>
<br>        
JSON PAGE USAGE - Game Description Page 1- This page is the one wher it briefly explains the game and the controls for it. This is for Click the Clown<br>  
 <br>
JSON PAGE USAGE - Game Description Page 2- This page is the one wher it briefly explains the game and the controls for it. This one is for Green Cube<br>        
<br>
**Disclaimer: These games are neither promised to be good, finished, nor even fun, as I will probably not overly refine them. I am merely showing the games, not selling them.**<br>
<br>

Green Cube - A simple platformer. Just a little box that can jump and traverse along the side with a very few simple puzzles. The webpage will give the instructions for game play, and a light introduction into why I made it and a brief description on how it was made.<br>
<br>
Click the Clown - An even simpler game about clicking on a clown that will make him go faster and move to a different spot. I made it entirely by following a tutorial and getting the said sprites from them as well.       
<!--
Tower Defense- A bunch of balloons, zombies, birds, etc. that will follow a pre-determined path that you do your best to make sure they never see the ending of by building small defensive structures to hold out against them. Just as the previous page had, it will outline the controls and gameplay that will also give a brief description of how I made it and why I made it the way I did.<br>
<br>
Bejewelled style switch game – There are several symbols that you get to try to make a line that when connected will break-apart or fall apart and you get a certain amount of points for the certain symbols .  Same as above, except I will probably make this game on Clickteam Fusion instead of Game Maker Studio.<br>
<br>
 A Very Simple FPS- This will probably be the least finished out of all of them, as it requires a lot more time, as it is 3D, and it will probably be short. There will be no gore of blood of any form, maybe not even enemies, just barrels. It depends on how much effort I can put into it.<br>
<br>
Asteroids- The classic Atari era game with slightly better graphics. Flying around and shooting asteroids is the entire point of the game.  As before, the webpage will be designed to describe the basics on the game.<br>
-->
<br>
A few of these games are well into development, with a bit more refinement needed. They’re what I do in some of my free time.<br>
<br>

<!--You could organize the items by content area or function to demonstrate relationships of pages to one another. A site diagram, while not required, could be useful (example - https://belindapullicino.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/picture-1.png).<br>-->
<br>

        
<br>
Persona - As a young, single, college kid, being frustrated out of my mind by certain projects, I need good simple entertainment to take my mind off of the projects and finals. I use danthomsen42@github.io to relax and take my mind off of the day, if only for a few seconds. Sometimes you need forms of fun you don't have to think to much about. and danthomsen42@github.io meets those requirements.<br>
<br>
Usability Concepts<br>
<br>

I will go down through the highlighted portions first. I will adjust the line spacing and font size so that it fits the page well and is very easy to read. The images will have a good alt tag. I will probably use said pictures as links to my games, so I will want the tags to be appropriate.<br>
Links will be in very clearly defined areas, both at the bottom and up in the tabs on the page.<br>
The headings will be clearly at the top of the page. Everything else is pretty well lined out with some easy to use and access well defined and viewable.<br>
<br>
SEO words: Games, Game Maker, In-development, flash style, free, easy, simple, Daniel Thomsen, early access, fun<br><br>

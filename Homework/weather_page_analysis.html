    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <img alt="Careful Mother" src="no-attribution- CC0 Public Domain mom-1252731_1920.jpg">
    <p>
    <p>Name: Andrea Eve</p>
    <p>Persona: As a young mother, I try to look out for what is best for my kids. <br>
        I also like to watch movies and look for good ones that both my family and I <br> 
        can enjoy. We often are on the road and often stop and use services like <br>
        Redbox. But as I'm on the road, I don't get a chance to look up certain key <br>
        information about the movies I rent on a computer. So I decided to start <br> 
        using IMDb. Using IMDb, I can quickly look up any information like ratings <br> and other content in these movies so that I can enjoy it with all of my kids.</p>
    <p> Recomondation: "I think that IMDb is the perfect website for anyone who wants
        to quickly get an idea of any movie."</p>
    <h3>Site Contrast</h3>
    <img alt="Bad BYUI" src="Capture2.PNG">
    <p>1. BYUI definetly knows that their target audience are young adults</p>
    <p>2. On a mobile device (and if you think Ilearn 3 no matter what device) the needs are met but very poorly</p>
    <p>3. It was organzied, just not easily usable</p>
    <p>4. The website was not optimized very well (if at all) for mobile devices. It runs, but it is not inherently simple on a mobile device.</p>

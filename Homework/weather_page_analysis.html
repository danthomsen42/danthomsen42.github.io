    <p>This website is to provide a basic wireframe and introduction for a weather website that I am developing.</p>
    <p>The basic purpose of this planned website is to be a weather<br> predictor/reporter that shows basic weather predicitons. It will be<br>
    user and mobile friendly. </p> 
    <p>Anyone who is planning any outdoor event or wardrobe choice will want to use this website.</p>

    <p>Name: Baden Powell</p>
    <p>Persona: A Scoutmaster: I work every week with young men, attempting <br>
        to teach young men valuable life skills. Many of these life skills <br> involve outdoor activites such as hiking, swimming, camping, etc. <br>
        In order to plan such activies, I need to know what the weather is <br>
        in the coming week. Luckily my weather is convieniently available on<br> multiple devices. I can plan activities and check the weather at home,<br>
        work or on the go. </p>
    <p> Recomondation: "I think that Weather Master is the perfect website for<br> anyone who wants to plan any outdoor activities."</p>

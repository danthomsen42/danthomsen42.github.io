    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>1. I would say that the target Audience of the International Movie Database <br>
          would be anyone, though more especially those who are old enough to care <br>
          about looking into said movies, so probably around 14 and up, and there <br>
          really isn't any other specific demographic it targets</p>
    <p>2. The website's purpose is well stated in its name. It is a database of <br>       
          most any movie. It has a good amount of space and only shows a limited<br>
          amount of items on it at a time so as not to overhelm the user.</p>
    <p>3. The website's organization is very well designed. It has trailers for <br>
          new releases and upcoming films right at the front. Underneath those <br>
          the links to the showtimes and ticket info are right there. The search <br>
          bar is right at the top and is easily seen and accessable. </p>
    <p>4. The nicest part of the website was that it was so user friendly. Not <br>
          only was the search engine very easy to use, the organization was very<br>
          nice and finding information on certain movies was extremely easy such<br>
          as parental reviews and guides.</p>
    <p>5. I would say that the website is very well optimized for those using a <br>
          mobile device. Individuals I believe would enjoy using its service.</p>

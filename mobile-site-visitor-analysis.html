    <h2>imdb.com | International Movie Database</h2>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>1. I would say that the target Audience of the International Movie Database <br>
          would be anyone, though more especially those who are old enough to care <br>
          about looking into said movies, so probably around 14 and up, and there <br>
          really isn't any other specific demographic it targets</p>
    <p>2. The website's purpose is well stated in its name. It is a database of <br>       
          most any movie. It has a good amount of space and only shows a limited<br>
          amount of items on it at a time so as not to overhelm the user.</p>
    <p>3. The website's organization is very well designed. It has trailers for <br>
          new releases and upcoming films right at the front. Underneath those <br>
          the links to the showtimes and ticket info are right there. The search <br>
          bar is right at the top and is easily seen and accessable. </p>
    <p>4. The nicest part of the website was that it was so user friendly. Not <br>
          only was the search engine very easy to use, the organization was very<br>
          nice and finding information on certain movies was extremely easy such<br>
          as parental reviews and guides.</p>
    <p>5. I would say that the website is very well optimized for those using a <br>
          mobile device. Individuals I believe would enjoy using its service.</p>

    <h3>Persona</h3>
    <img alt="Careful Mother" src="no-attribution- CC0 Public Domain mom-1252731_1920.jpg">
    <p>
    <p>Name: Andrea Eve</p>
    <p>Persona: As a young mother, I try to look out for what is best for my kids. <br>
        I also like to watch movies and look for good ones that both my family and I <br> 
        can enjoy. We often are on the road and often stop and use services like <br>
        Redbox. But as I'm on the road, I don't get a chance to look up certain key <br>
        information about the movies I rent on a computer. So I decided to start <br> 
        using IMDb. Using IMDb, I can quickly look up any information like ratings <br> and other content in these movies so that I can enjoy it with all of my kids.</p>
    <p> Recomondation: "I think that IMDb is the perfect website for anyone who wants
        to quickly get an idea of any movie."</p>
    <h3>Site Contrast</h3>
    <img alt="Bad BYUI" src="Capture2.PNG">
    <p>1. BYUI definetly knows that their target audience are young adults</p>
    <p>2. On a mobile device (and if you think Ilearn 3 no matter what device) the needs are met but very poorly</p>
    <p>3. It was organzied, just not easily usable</p>
    <p>4. The website was not optimized very well (if at all) for mobile devices. It runs, but it is not inherently simple on a mobile device.</p>

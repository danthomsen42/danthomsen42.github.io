    <h2>imdb.com | International Movie Database</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>1. I would say that the target Audience of the International Movie Database <br>
          would be anyone, though more especially those who are old enough to care <br>
          about looking into said movies, so probably around 14 and up, and there <br>
          really isn't any other specific demographic it targets</p>
    <p>2. The website's purpose is well stated in its name. It is a database of <br>       most any movie. It has a good amount of space and only shows a limited           amount of items on it at a time so as not to overhelm the user.</p>
    <p>3. The website's organization is very well designed. It has trailers for <br>       new releases and upcoming films right at the front. Underneath those <br>         the links to the showtimes and ticket info are right there. The search <br>       bar is right at the top and is easily seen and accessable. </p>
